## Taccom Project :: Specifics 

FUNCTIONALITY 
- after inventory is gone, you can't land on it anymore 
- has a "database" of prizes 

Theory 
- store inventory in an object
- if a prize is won, and there are no more, then that prize should no longer be available 
- the next prize in the next randomization, goes to the other 4 that are left 

BREAKDOWN 
- break the wheel up into segments 
- make each segment fade in/out
- have a "dead" version of the segment (update the js file). this is gonna be FUN

PRIZE POOL 
- want to go in the back, see there's 0 notepads, and they need to re-order 


### Taccom Stuff 

- overlay on top of the wheel
    - the wheel itself is grayed out (or the whole page is grayed out)
        - "Fill in to Spin!"  
    - when the user enters their information, and confirms, the wheel fades in 
    - the "SPIN NOW" button become active 

- gun ticker 

- when you win, implement the PINK BOX from this spin-to-win 
    - http://tradeshowdemo.brandm3dia.com/Apps/Spin&win(1)/three/spin2win.html 
    - center the winning modal, and style it 
    - solid background 
    - add taccom logo to the winning popup
    - add more white space
    - add text warping effect from 
        - http://tradeshowdemo.brandm3dia.com/Apps/Spin&win(1)/three/spin2win.html  

- get mp3 sounds for any that you want 
    - click on button
    - while it's spinning (e.g. drumroll) 
    - ticker click (have two to choose from) 
    - winning sound at the end (pull from Rigo) 
    - (rigo) fireworks effect that will also play a sound 

- fireworks 
    - pull Rigo's example from old spin-to-win (wordpress)(ontario college) 
    - download these, too :: https://codecanyon.net/item/javascript-fireworks-animation/16692638 

- **emails you**
    - Subject: thank you for playing spin-to-win 
    - Body: plain text, or content with an image 

:: 

- **inventory** 
    - you know which prizes you have, and how many of them 
    - each time a prize is won, the counter goes down one 
    - when the counter drops to 0, it fades out, and you can no longer win 
    - **admin section to UPDATE the values (e.g. new items added)**  

- information that they want to download ( CSV format )

    - all the leads (including the prizes that were won)
        { 
            same object as before ;; get rid of the fun 
        }

    - they print off the current inventory 
        { 
            name : Xbox,
            stock : 5, 
            totalWon : 3
        }
    - we can update these from the back-end     
        - this is where Admin panel would be useful

### Nice to Have

-------------------------------------------------
## Moving Points 

- Ask Ase and Ember to step up, and put in more hours. 
- Ase will have to contribute more, and give me less work ( e.g. wtf is this "did you have fun?" )

- Ember, if she wants to 
    -
