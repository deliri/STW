# Work Log :: August 21, 2019 

> It's `1:57` and I'm too angry to sleep. Can't eat in this state. Will just work. Work until the morning. This is the only thing I want to do. Get rid of my work. What a truly horrible existence.  


## Steps to Take 

- make taccom default

Failures 
- struggle and fail with virtual keyboard. giving up for now. 
- rescale height of the canvas once the wheel is drawn. doesn't work. 


- add ticker sound and click from sound
- ensure responsive 

- stack the form on top of the wheel ( will I need position absolute? fucking hell... )
- make a content wrapper inside the wheel 

- make a centered flex for the parent of the popup 



## UPDATE 04:35 -- Remaining TODO 

- Rigo is full of shit. Weighted percentage was NOT working. Will have to code my own randomizer, with weighted averages
    - https://stackoverflow.com/questions/46906933/javascript-spin-wheel-prize-selection-based-on-percentage 


Remaining Things to Do 

- [x] simulate server with localStorage 

- [x] design a new wheel 
- [x] divide it into segments
- [x] create a prize pool
- [x] if prizes are finished, fade the image of the wheel and refresh it
    - **ALTERTATIVE :: prizes at zero can no longer be won** 

- [x] admin page showing all the wins 
- [x] admin page showing prize pool 
    
- [x] button to download CSV of winners
- [x] button to download CSV of prizes (current prize pool numbers, with date)

- [x] when loading wheel, duplicate it, work off the duplicate
- [x] check against prize pool. update the wheel when prizes become obsolete 

- [x] clone the wheel data object on load 
- [x] update all references for the wheel, to use the cloned copy 
- [x] have a "refresh" function that reloads the wheel from the duplicate (admin section)

- [ ] admin button for require registration
- [x] update without refreshing the page (initLayers() with the new settings)
- [x] check form validation with every keyUp

- [x] add sexy alert windows
- [x] update alert messages, when the form is not complete 
- [x] ready button is auto-updated, when the form is valid 
- [x] click "ok" to spin
- [x] number of spins displayed somewhere
- [ ] update number of spins with each spin
- [ ] when hitting last spin, new dialog "thank you for playing" 

- [ ] improved "claim prize" functionality 
    - **requires the creation of a "user submitted" variable -- the game is OVER and the user has not spun again**
    - it's at THIS point that the prize pool updates 

- [ ] if "claim prize" is selected, the user's data is submitted
- [ ] if the user loses (on their last spin), then data is automatically submitted 

- [ ] detect losing spins 
- [ ] system for good and bad
- [ ] make a "try again" system 

- [x] **it gets its data from the FORM, so Ase is going to have to make this update**
    - in the meantime, I can update the javascript wheel object
    - resetting the wheel will reset the js object. **so make a duplicate object, and back it up**
    - USE JQUERY OBJECT DUPLICATION!!! It's easy to fuck this up 

- [ ] draw a diagram to map out this system 

- [x] prize timeout() that will reset the form if the person walks away 
- [ ] timeout, if the user fills in information, and walks off 


## August 21, 16:52 

- IDEA :: don't do the segmented thing, yet. Just make it impossible to land on the prizes that are empty. 
- Will have to make a randomizer, but I'm doing that anyway. 
- So... let's make weighted randoms.  


## August 22, 16:05 

IDEA :: Add a `mute` mode . 


DONE :: useless function in form 
- GetUserFormData ( form-helpers.js )
- either push it to a function, or get rid of it entirely! 


IDEA :: Alert Behavior  

- if trying to click submit, alert will pop up 
- otherwise, it'll highlight the fields we need 
- tab should get to the next input 

- `Title, Error, Icon` :: please fill in the form 

- `Custom Animation` :: When you win the prize 
    - this is where we add the old rigo animation, too. 
    - first, find it 
    - also use : A message with custom width, padding, background and animated Nyan Cat :: `backdrop` for fireworks n' shit 

- `Restore From Backup` :: A confirm dialog, with a function attached to the "Confirm"-button...


IDEA :: last prize won
- in case plebs can't remember, you'll hit the Admin area and check what the last winner was 
- alt :: can see the list of winners, and what they won 


### TODO Revisited 

### Registration 

- [x] import sexy alert 

- re-enable mandatory registration 
- update styles for mega-button 

- add keyboard to the input screen
- create the "currentlyFocused" variable for the input fields 
- when tapping on a field, the on-screen keyboard will update only the selected field 
- test this keyboard, with these inputs 

- investigate multiple keyboards on-screen 
- create a toggle for the keyboards, depending on which is needed
- create a keyboardManager that will handle these functions 

- separation of javascript 
    - wheel-helper 
    - form-helper ( server-side functions :: rename to server-helper )
        - move wheel-related variables and functions to wheel-helper
    - integrate with keyboard-helper that will manage different keyboards, and receive input 

- validate form completion on keyUp
    - already works, with bootstrap/css on `sumbit`
    - don't want to do it with `submit` 
    - I bet plenty of others have run into this problem; let's build off that :) 


### Data Management 

- trace wheel loading information 
- remove non-critical wheels ( keep image , custom , and taccom )
    - retard rigo is like "duhh, they should all have sound. they should all be responsive" 
    - keep the data files for REFERENCE, somewhere else in the data folder 

- clone the original _rawData["taccom"] into a variable (`backup`)
- **work off of the *ORIGINAL* file. This is easier to handle**
    - a "reset" function will restore from the backup ( later managed on the server ) 

- keep track of the "current" wheel 
- can change wheel on the fly, depending on the data given 
    - can keep using a unique ID for this
    - Ase can man the fuck up, and build a robust system. instead of whining about shit, to result in the least amount of work he has to do
